## Inspiration
Lets everyone find their favorite products nearby. Why to look for them thousands of miles away when they might be very close!

## What it does
Using Geolocation it connects each potential buyer to seller within a certain radius. By default the radius only is limited to the city one is located in. 
Buyonear __shows you what you want !!__ It allows searches by uploading a picture or typing a tag that identifies your product.
If the search is done by a picture, it will use __artificial intelligence__ to recognize what's inside the picture and show related results !

## How its built
PHP, Android Studio, Digital Ocean, Parse, __Machine learning__, Java, MySQL, Clarifai.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into technical challenges with SSH and AWS, but that didn't stop us!  as our greatest shark friend, DigitalOcean VPS gave us the opportunity to continue regardless of the time lost.
Our Android Studios were victim of Murphy and its law! 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Efficient tag queries thanks to Parse. 
* Facebook Login integration with Android. 
* Clarifai PHP library development for censoring potential pornographic images uploaded by buyers/sellers
* DigitalOcean is beautiful!

## What we learned
Machine Learning is not as beautiful as when its used!
